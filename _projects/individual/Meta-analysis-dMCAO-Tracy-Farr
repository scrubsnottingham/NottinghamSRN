Jewel Ahmed is a PhD Candidate in the School of Life Sciences who is conducting a meta-analysis to systemically identify the different functional assessment used following dMCAO (distal MCA occlusion model). This review will highlight the most (and least) useful tests of the dMCAO model, thereby allowing stroke researchers to make an informed and objective decision in the tests that are used when employing this model. Students who are keen to learn about meta-analysis are encouraged to apply. Please note that some flexibilty will be required as the work load may not coincide within term timeframes.
